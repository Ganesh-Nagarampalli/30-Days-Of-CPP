# Socket Programming in C++

## What is a socket?

A socket is one endpoint of a two-way communication link between two programs running on the network. A socket is bound to a port number so that the TCP layer can identify the application that data is destined to.

**Example**: When you open a web browser and type a URL (like https://www.google.com), your browser opens a socket and connects to the web server. The web server then sends the requested web page to your browser, which is displayed on your screen.

## Types of Sockets

There are two types of sockets:

1. **Stream Sockets (TCP)**: Stream sockets use the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) for communication. They provide a reliable, connection-oriented communication between two programs.

    **Example**: When you open a web browser and connect to a web server, the communication between the browser and the server is done using TCP stream sockets.

2. **Datagram Sockets (UDP)**: Datagram sockets use the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) for communication. They provide an unreliable, connectionless communication between two programs.

    **Example**: When you send a message over a chat application, the communication between the sender and receiver is done using UDP datagram sockets.

## Understanding Socket Programming

Socket programming is a way of connecting two nodes on a network to communicate with each other. One socket (node) listens on a particular port at an IP, while the other socket reaches out to the other to form a connection. The server forms the listener socket while the client reaches out to the server.

## Stages of Socket Programming

1. **Creating a Socket**: The first step in socket programming is to create a socket using the `socket()` system call. The `socket()` system call creates a new socket and returns a file descriptor that can be used to refer to the socket.

2. **Binding a Socket**: The next step is to bind the socket to an IP address and port number using the `bind()` system call. This step is necessary for the server to listen on a specific IP address and port.

3. **Listening for Connections (Server)**: If you are creating a server, you need to listen for incoming connections using the `listen()` system call. This step allows the server to accept incoming connections from clients.

4. **Accepting a Connection (Server)**: Once the server is listening for connections, it can accept incoming connections using the `accept()` system call. This step creates a new socket for the client and allows the server to communicate with the client.

5. **Connecting to a Server (Client)**: If you are creating a client, you need to connect to a server using the `connect()` system call. This step establishes a connection between the client and the server.

6. **Sending and Receiving Data**: Once the connection is established, the client and server can send and receive data using the `send()`, `recv()`, `sendto()`, and `recvfrom()` system calls.

7. **Closing the Socket**: Finally, once the communication is complete, the client and server can close the socket using the `close()` system call.


## Socket Programming in C++

In C++, socket programming is done using the `socket()` system call, which creates a new socket. The `socket()` system call takes three arguments:

1. **Domain**: The domain specifies the communication domain in which the socket should be created. For example, `AF_INET` for IPv4 communication.

2. **Type**: The type specifies the communication semantics. For example, `SOCK_STREAM` for stream sockets (TCP) and `SOCK_DGRAM` for datagram sockets (UDP).

3. **Protocol**: The protocol specifies the protocol to be used with the socket. It can be set to `0` to use the default protocol for the given domain and type.

Here is an example of a simple TCP server and client program in C++:

### TCP Server

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <sys/socket.h>
#include <netinet/in.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <cstring>

int main() {
    // Create a socket
    int server_socket = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0);

    // Bind the socket to an IP address and port
    struct sockaddr_in server_address;
    server_address.sin_family = AF_INET;
    server_address.sin_port = htons(9002);
    server_address.sin_addr.s_addr = INADDR_ANY;
    bind(server_socket, (struct sockaddr*)&server_address, sizeof(server_address));

    // Listen for incoming connections
    listen(server_socket, 5);

    // Accept a new connection
    int client_socket = accept(server_socket, NULL, NULL);

    // Send data to the client
    char server_message[256] = "Hello from server!";
    send(client_socket, server_message, sizeof(server_message), 0);

    // Close the sockets
    close(client_socket);
    close(server_socket);

    return 0;
}
```

### TCP Client

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <sys/socket.h>
#include <netinet/in.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <cstring>

int main() {
    // Create a socket
    int client_socket = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0);

    // Connect to the server
    struct sockaddr_in server_address;
    server_address.sin_family = AF_INET;
    server_address.sin_port = htons(9002);
    server_address.sin_addr.s_addr = INADDR_ANY;
    connect(client_socket, (struct sockaddr*)&server_address, sizeof(server_address));

    // Receive data from the server
    char server_response[256];
    recv(client_socket, &server_response, sizeof(server_response), 0);

    // Print the server's response
    std::cout << "Server: " << server_response << std::endl;

    // Close the socket
    close(client_socket);

    return 0;
}
```
### output

```bash
Server: Hello from server!
```


In the above example, the server creates a socket, binds it to an IP address and port, listens for incoming connections, accepts a new connection, sends data to the client, and closes the sockets. The client creates a socket, connects to the server, receives data from the server, prints the server's response, and closes the socket.

### UDP Server

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <sys/socket.h>
#include <netinet/in.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <cstring>

int main() {
    // Create a socket
    int server_socket = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_DGRAM, 0);

    // Bind the socket to an IP address and port
    struct sockaddr_in server_address;
    server_address.sin_family = AF_INET;
    server_address.sin_port = htons(9002);
    server_address.sin_addr.s_addr = INADDR_ANY;
    bind(server_socket, (struct sockaddr*)&server_address, sizeof(server_address));

    // Receive data from the client
    char client_message[256];
    struct sockaddr_in client_address;
    socklen_t client_address_len = sizeof(client_address);
    recvfrom(server_socket, client_message, sizeof(client_message), 0, (struct sockaddr*)&client_address, &client_address_len);

    // Print the client's message
    std::cout << "Client: " << client_message << std::endl;

    // Close the socket
    close(server_socket);

    return 0;
}
```

### UDP Client

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <sys/socket.h>
#include <netinet/in.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <cstring>

int main() {
    // Create a socket
    int client_socket = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_DGRAM, 0);

    // Send data to the server
    struct sockaddr_in server_address;
    server_address.sin_family = AF_INET;
    server_address.sin_port = htons(9002);
    server_address.sin_addr.s_addr = INADDR_ANY;
    sendto(client_socket, "Hello from client!", sizeof("Hello from client!"), 0, (struct sockaddr*)&server_address, sizeof(server_address));

    // Close the socket
    close(client_socket);

    return 0;
}
```

### output

```bash
Client: Hello
```

## Applications of Socket Programming

Socket programming is used in a wide range of applications, including:

1. **Web Servers**: Web servers use sockets to communicate with web browsers and serve web pages over the network.

2. **Chat Applications**: Chat applications use sockets to send messages between users in real-time.

3. **File Transfer Applications**: File transfer applications use sockets to transfer files between two computers over the network.

4. **Remote Desktop Applications**: Remote desktop applications use sockets to control a remote computer over the network.

5. **Online Games**: Online games use sockets to send game data between players in real-time.



## Conclusion

Socket programming in C++ allows you to create networked applications that can communicate with each other over the network. By using sockets, you can build client-server applications, peer-to-peer applications, and more. Understanding socket programming is essential for building networked applications in C++.
